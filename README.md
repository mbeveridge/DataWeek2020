### --- :: Data Science and COVID 19 & Data Week Introduction
###### [ Prof Kate Robson Brown : Director of the JGI ]


### IP :: Intermediate Python
###### [ [Matt Williams](https://twitter.com/milliams), Christopher Edsall : Advanced Computing Research Centre ]

* *"In general I recommend that you use the Python Console to experiment while going through the examples and then use the text editor to write the answers to the exercises before running them in the terminal"*


### --- :: Increasing Engagement with your Data
###### [ Michael Green : [Luna 9](https://twitter.com/luna9design) ]

* *"Data is only useful if you can explain what it means"*


### IDA :: Introduction to data analysis in Python
###### [ [Matt Williams](https://twitter.com/milliams), Alastair Tanner : Advanced Computing Research Centre ]

[ `pandas`; `matplotlib` ]


### TAB :: Do you want to be a Data Rockstar?
###### [ [Luke Stoughton](https://twitter.com/barnsleybeast) : The Information Lab ]


### ADA :: Applied data analysis in Python
###### [ Chris Woods, [Matt Williams](https://twitter.com/milliams) : Advanced Computing Research Centre ]

[ `scikit-learn` ]


### --- :: New data on COVID-19 is undermined by old statistical problems
###### [ [Gibran Hemani](https://twitter.com/explodecomputer) : University of Bristol]

* *"My main aim is convince you that a problem known as ‘collider bias’, which arises when your samples are selected non-randomly, is a serious threat to the validity of inferences being made from these data."*

* *"Have a look at this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/bristimtom/status/1250731747039379456?s=20) for a gentle introduction, and links to a blog post and recent paper on the subject."*


### --- :: Introduction to deep learning
###### [ [Matt Williams](https://twitter.com/milliams), Lester Hedges : Advanced Computing Research Centre ]

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) [[iris.ipynb]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/milliams/intro_deep_learning/blob/master/iris.ipynb) [[mnist.ipynb]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/milliams/intro_deep_learning/blob/master/mnist.ipynb)

* *'NN's have been around for decades ... "deep neural networks" (DNN) have become possible ... starting the modern buzz for "deep learning"'*

* Popular NN libraries are : PyTorch; TensorFlow; (Keras (a wrapper); Caffe2; scikit-learn) ...In this workshop, we use **TensorFlow with a little bit of Keras**

* Google's [AI principles](https://blog.google/technology/ai/ai-principles/)
